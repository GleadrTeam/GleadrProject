SoftUni Overflow is a programming forum where people can share ideas and ask questions.

Main functionalities that have been implemented are:

-Creating user profile
-Logging in
-Creating a topic
-Posting replies to a topic

In User Profile Page you can:

-Edit your avatar
-Add location
-Add birth date
-See your profile information

Error & Security checks have been added to make sure that no one enters without a registration and the MySQL database is safe.
The topics are presented by the date and time the last user has posted. So the most recent answer will be at the top.
